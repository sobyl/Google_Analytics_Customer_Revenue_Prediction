# Dataset
[Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction/overview)

# Objective
This project will analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer.

# Motivation
The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businessesâ€“only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies. Online store analysis can educate the types of products customers like best. This can help make more educated decisions when it comes to product creation or curation for stores.

# Challenges
The data is really huge. The size of train data is 25.41GB with 55 colunms and 903,653 rows. It will take a lot of time to load and handle the data, much more time to build the model. And there are some of the fields are in json format, which need to convert to a flattened csv format for further analyse.
