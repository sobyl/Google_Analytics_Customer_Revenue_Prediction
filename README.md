The train data set collects view information of every Gstore customers and their cost from August 1st, 2016 to May 1st, 2018.

The test data set collects view information of every Gstore customers from December 1st, 2018 to January 31st, 2019, and the target is to predict how much they will spend on GStore during this period.

# Objective
This project will analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict how much each customer will spend money on Gstore from December 1st, 2018 to January 31st, 2019.
As submission sample, using fullVisitorId as unique identifier for each customer and any other useful features to predict revenue per customer, which name as "transactionRevenue" in totals chunk.

# Motivation
The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businessesâ€“only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies.

Online store analysis can educate the types of products customers like, customers distribution and many other useful factors. This can help make more educated decisions when it comes to product creation or curation for stores. I think this project may be more related to future work, and helpful accumulate realted experience.

# Challenges
The data set are really huge. The size of train data is 25.41GB with 12 colunms (if flatten all json columns, there will be more than 100 columns) and 1,708,337 rows. It will take a lot of time and memory to load and handle the data. The target value is unbalanced distribution, $98.9\%$ of them are NaN, and some of the rest are very larger.
